## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AshwinKumar-V/InteriorConsultant/main/.github/images/Screenshot.jpg)

Hey there devs! This was my third project at devChallenges.io to build a responsive website. This project required JavaScript for some additional functionalities such as collapsed navigation in mobile view and to bring up the navigation upon clicking the menu icon. I managed to enforce it more using CSS rather than JavaScript.
You can checkout my demo [here](https://ashwinkumar-v.github.io/InteriorConsultant/).
